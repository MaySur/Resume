                <p  class="ss-summary">  
                    The A.I. Simple Answer Application was developed using Python, Flask, OpenAI API, 
                    and Git. The goal of the project was to create a web application that could answer
                    user-generated questions using artificial intelligence.
                    </p>
                <p  class="ss-summary">  
                    The development process started with creating a Flask-based web application. 
                    Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that provides various tools and 
                    libraries to create web applications quickly and easily. With Flask, I was able 
                    to create a simple user interface where users could input their questions and 
                    receive answers from the AI model.                        
                </p>
                <p  class="ss-summary">  
                        To incorporate the AI component, I utilized the OpenAI API. OpenAI API is a 
                    cloud-based AI platform that provides developers with access to various 
                    pre-trained models for natural language processing, language generation, and 
                    other AI-related tasks. By leveraging the OpenAI API, I was able to build a 
                    question and answer application that could understand user-generated questions 
                    and provide relevant answers.                       
                </p>
                <p  class="ss-summary">  
                    To test the capabilities of the AI model, I conducted several tests on individual 
                    engines and compared resulting answers. OpenAI API provides access to different 
                    language models such as Davinci, Ada, Curie, and Babbage. Each engine has its 
                    own strengths and weaknesses, and by testing each engine, 
                    I was able to determine which engine produced the most accurate results 
                    for our application.                      
                </p>
                <p  class="ss-summary">  
                    Furthermore, I manipulated the type of answer expected by giving sample answers 
                    to the API to use. This allowed us to control the type of response the application 
                    provided, whether it was a short answer, a paragraph, or a full-length article. By 
                    manipulating the type of answer expected, I was able to fine-tune the application to
                     provide the best possible results.                       
                </p>
