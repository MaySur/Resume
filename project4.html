                    This website serves the West Chester University's Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology's new exhibition, <i>"<a href="https://www.wcupa.edu/sciences-mathematics/anthropologySociology/museum/surrounded-by-the-spirits.aspx", target="_blank">Surrounded By The Spirits</a>"</i>. 
                    It involved collaboration with an interviewer, video editor, and website creator.

                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maclaren-macleod-remy/", target="_blank">MacLaren Remy</a>, a History major with a passion for Anthropology, conducted four engaging Zoom sessions with 
                    <a href="https://paulstollersblog.wordpress.com/", target="_blank">Dr. Paul Stoller</a>. 
                    These sessions unearthed valuable narratives about the West African Songhay community's cultural richness and traditions.

                    and creating shorter clips. These clips were uploaded to YouTube to reach a broader audience, with final touches by Ryan Riley.

                    I developed the website using React.JS, delivering the interview content in an easy and interactive manner for the exhibit's audience. Visitors can explore <a href="https://paulstollersblog.wordpress.com/", target="_blank">Dr. Paul Stoller's</a> work and engage with the Oral History application dynamically. The site's user-friendly design accommodates different learning styles, making it ideal for distance learning and promoting accessibility.

                    I used React.JS to make the website more interactive and modular, ensuring compatibility with various screen sizes. Additionally, I designed it to be accessible to all viewers, minimizing difficulties for website visitors.

                <p  class="ss-summary">  
                    Furthermore, I utilized the GitHub Pages platform to host the website, providing an easily accessible link that is live and linked to the university's main website.
